# Gale Shapley Visualizer
This is a visualization tool designed to help you to better understand the stable matching algorithm known as the Gale-Shapley Algorithm (1962). I created this to aid students of the University of Pennsylvania, but really it is free for everyone to experiment with.

Using this visualizer is incredibly simple: just enter the number of matches, along with the list of Proposers, Recipients, and each person's Preferences, then take advantage of this tool's powerful animation and playback capabilities.

Huge credit goes to the creators of the React.js framework and the incredible animation engine known as anime.js. Special thanks to "jmdisuanco" for creating this wrapper library which allowed me to easily create these animations.

Please email robintan@wharton.upenn.edu for any suggestions to improve this tool.
